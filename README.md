# Portfolio
This weeks project was to build a portfolio using HTML and CSS. Then we should test the site on different devices, sites + chech the accessibility.

# The problem
I feel like I'm really behind and that I can't finish the projects on the given time (one week). For me just to code the portfolio as wanted (using the given deisgn) has taken me the whole week and I'm not even finished yet. Haven't even started with the testing and accessibility :(.
